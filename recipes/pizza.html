        <h2>This easy pizza dough recipe is great for beginners and produces a soft homemade pizza crust..</h2>
        <p>All pizza dough starts with the same basic ingredients: flour, yeast, water, salt, and olive oil. Here's the breakdown of what I use in my homemade pizza crust recipe.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Yeast</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Cornmeal</li>
          
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the dough: Mix the dough ingredients together by hand or use a hand-held or stand mixer</li>
            <li>Knead: Knead by hand or with your mixer. I like doing this by hand</li>
            <li>Rise: Place dough into a greased mixing bowl, cover tightly, and set aside to rise for about 90 minutes or overnight in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>Punch & shape: Punch down risen dough to release air bubbles. Divide in 2. Roll dough out into a 12-inch circle. Cover and rest as you prep the pizza toppings.</li>
            <li>Top it: Top with favorite pizza toppings</li>
            <li>Bake: Bake pizza at very high temperature for only 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
